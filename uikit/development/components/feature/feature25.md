# Feature25

This code defines a React component `Feature25` that displays a section with a heading, optional caption, and a grid of icon cards. Each icon card presents an icon, title, and content. Below the grid, a graphics card may be rendered, containing a secondary heading, caption, and an optional image alongside a primary button. The layout is structured using MUI's `Grid`, `Stack`, and other components for responsive design.
