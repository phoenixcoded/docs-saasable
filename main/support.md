# Support

Our support primarily handles pre-sales inquiries, basic template questions, and bug reports through our support panel: [https://codedthemes.support-hub.io/](https://codedthemes.support-hub.io/).

We encourage customers to submit feature requests and suggestions to enhance our premium themes. All requests will be reviewed, and future updates may include new features.

### Before submitting a ticket

Please ensure you're using the latest version of the theme. Thoroughly review the theme's documentation and check public tickets to see if your question has already been answered. Additionally, watch the template introduction, folder structure, and customisation videos to find potential solutions.

### While submitting the ticket

When starting a new ticket, please provide as much detail as possible. It helps us identify the root cause of your issue if you provide a link to your site, a screenshot of the error message, a code snippet, or all of the above. The more detailed information you provide, the quicker we can resolve your issue, as it clarifies the understanding and allows for a more accurate response.

### After submitting the ticket

* Normally, we will get back to customers in 12-24 hours on normal business days.
* The tickets will be prioritised as they come to us, on a first-come, first-served basis.

- We solely focus on delivering the UI interface and do not offer support for functionalities beyond the product scope. If any additional service, like a fake backend or others, is provided for customer convenience and faster integration, the customer is advised to make changes as per their needs.
- If you have specific features in mind, feel free to submit a feature request. We'll assess its feasibility, and if deemed appropriate, we'll consider including it in the next version release.
- Additionally, we offer a fee-based service tailored to meet our customers' requirements and preferences.
